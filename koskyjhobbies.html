    <br>I have danced competitvely for 13+ years. I have training in jazz, ballet, lyrical, contemporary, musical theater, and more. I taught and assited teachers during certain dance classes in ages ranging from 2-11. Dance is my passion and I am glad to have such an outlet in my life.

    <br>Most of my life I have been an artistic person. I enjoy doodling, drawing, hand lettering, and almost all forms of art. Though I wouldn't call myself an artist by any means but, I do enjoy it.
